## 2. How to Contribute

### Branch Naming Conventions

All branches must follow these naming patterns:

- **`feature/<description>`** ‚Äî New features or enhancements
- **`bugfix/<description>`** ‚Äî Fixes for known bugs
- **`hotfix/<description>`** ‚Äî Urgent fixes for production issues
- **`release/<version>`** ‚Äî Preparing a release (e.g., `release/2.0.0`)
- **`temporary/<description>`** ‚Äî Short-lived experiments or spikes (not for long-term use)

**Examples:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/lane-detection
git checkout -b bugfix/collision-check
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-memory-leak
git checkout -b release/1.5.0
git checkout -b temporary/test-new-planner
```

Branch names must use lowercase letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, or underscores only.

### Commit Guidelines

All commits must be signed off using the `--signoff` flag:

```bash
git commit --signoff -m "Add new trajectory planner"
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message, which is required for compliance with the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).

### Reporting Issues
- Ensure the issue has not already been reported.
- Provide a clear title and detailed description, including:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, Architecture, etc...)
- Label the issue according to the project's conventions if applicable.

### Suggesting Features
- Propose enhancements or extensions, e.g., for planning algorithms or simulation integration (CARLA, SUMO).
- Describe use cases and potential benefits.

### Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

1. Create a feature branch following the naming conventions:
   ```bash  
   git checkout -b feature/my-enhancement  
   ```
2. Commit changes with descriptive messages using `--signoff`.
3. Rebase on the latest `develop` branch to keep history clean:
   ```bash  
   git fetch upstream  
   git rebase upstream/develop  
   ```
4. Push to your fork and open a PR against `develop`.
5. In your PR description, explain:
   - What the change addresses.
   - Any new dependencies or configuration adjustments.
   - How to test it.
6. Ensure you have signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA); PRs from contributors without a signed ECA will not be merged.

### Code Style & Quality
- Adhere to the repository's formatting and style rules.
  - **C++**: follow `.clang-format`
  - **Python / Shell**: match formatting of existing code
  - Maintain clean, readable commit history
- If applicable, ensure tests are included or updated.
- Large files exceeding the repository's size limit (defined in `adore.env`) will be rejected by commit hooks.

### Documentation
- Add or update docs in the `documentation/technical_reference_manual` folder:
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples or reference manual
  - Architecture overviews, etc.
- Keep documentation consistent with existing style and structure.
- Spell check your contributions with `aspell`. This is included in the documentation directory. 
Run the following command to spell check your documentation:
```bash
cd documentation
make spellcheck
```
